  <h1>Why Sports Analytics?</h1>
    <p> I get a lot of puzzled looks whenever I mention that I do sports analytics on top of public policy and economics. What is puzzling to them is the fact that I have taken the task of sports analytics as more than just a hobby, but as an unpaid profession that takes more than a typical hobby would. During the average college football season not only do I watch the games with an analytical(and fanatical) eye, but I read and craft weekly pieces of statistical analytics about the California Golden Bears.</p>
    <p> Furthermore, during the offseason I add data visualizations to look deeper into the world of college football in the context of the Golden Bears as well as the NFL Draft. Here I have some examples of my work in the field.</p>
    <p> All of my work in this field has been hosted on the <a href = "http://www.sbnation.com/users/Piotr%20T%20Le/blog"> <i>California Golden Blogs</i> under the name Piotr T Le</a>. </p>
    <p> Note: Stanford is called Stanfurd on these charts due to the nomenclature of the blog to poke fun at our rivals. </p>

      <td> The Simple-Ranking-System uses the point differential and a teams performance relative to the point differential in order to estimate a team's quality outside of the win/loss column.
      <br> 
      <p>What we can see here is that it wasn’t just the difficulty of the schedule that lead to the overall decline in outcomes for Cal football. It was also the decline in relative quality of the Cal teams. In the Post-Waldorf era Cal has had difficulty living up to the standard set by previous teams.</p>
      <p>However, Cal hasn’t had a problem in fielding above average teams sans the Joe Kapp/Marv Levy eras. A little solace in the fact that though we may not be remarkable as it was during the Waldorf era, we still are decent. Another note is that the worst Cal team ever was the 2013 Sonny Dykes 1-11 season, being slightly worse than the 2001 1-10 Tom Holmoe season. Sad indeed. </p></td>

      <tr>
      <td> <p> Strength of Schedule takes the aggregate win/loss ratio of the opponents that Cal faced in the given season. The higher the number, the tougher the schedule was. </p>
      <p> We can see here is this: Cal and Furd break the trend overall between SOS and win pct. What we can see here is that no matter how easy or hard your schedule is on paper, most of the time you’re an average team. For example Furd had both a 0.000 and 1.000 season on SOS of ~10. One would traditionally associate harder schedules with lower performance, as it is with Cal.</p></td>

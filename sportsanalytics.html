  <h1>Why Sports Analytics?</h1>
    <p> I get a lot of puzzled looks whenever I mention that I do sports analytics on top of public policy and economics. What is puzzling to them is the fact that I have taken the task of sports analytics as more than just a hobby, but as an unpaid profession that takes more than a typical hobby would. During the average college football season not only do I watch the games with an analytical(and fanatical) eye, but I read and craft weekly pieces of statistical analytics about the California Golden Bears.</p>
    <p> Furthermore, during the offseason I add data visualizations to look deeper into the world of college football in the context of the Golden Bears as well as the NFL Draft. Here I have some examples of my work in the field.</p>
    <p> All of my work in this field has been hosted on the <a href = "http://www.sbnation.com/users/Piotr%20T%20Le/blog"> <i>California Golden Blogs</i> under the name Piotr T Le</a>.
